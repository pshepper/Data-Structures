# Data-Structures
Implementation of Data Structures

# Why do this project
As a computer science student I've done a lot of learning about data structures. I believe it to be a good exercise to take all the information I leanred and put it into a single place. 
This mini-project also gives me a good opportunity to get more comfortable with git, command lines, test, and python in general.
Long term goals include:
    1. Visualization
    2. Methods to index data
