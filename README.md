# Data-Structures
Implementation of Data Structures

# Why do this project
As a computer science student I've done a lot of learning about data structures. I believe it to be a good exercise to take all the information I leanred and put it into a single place. 
This mini-project also gives me a good opportunity to get more comfortable with git, command lines, test, and python in general.
Long term goals include:
    1. Visualization
    2. Complex functions (sorting, reverse, etc.)
    

| Data Structure | Description | Completion Status |
|----------------|-------------------| ------------|
| Doubly Linked List | Linear structure where nodes are linked with the node after and before | Basic functionality finished |
| Single Linked List | Linear structure where nodes are linked only with the node after | Basic functionality finished | 
| Undirected Graph | Non-linear structure where nodes have any number of adjacent nodes. Edges go both ways | Basic functionality finished |
| Directed graph | Non-linear structure where nodes have any number of adjacent nodes. Edges go only one direction | Basic functionality finished |
| Tree | Non-linear structure where nodes have 'child' nodes | Basic functionality finished |
| Binary tree | Non-linear structure where each node can only have two children | Basic functionality finished |
